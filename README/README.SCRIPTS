EVENTDISPLAY - IACT event analysis and display - scripts
========================================================

There are a large number of useful scripts in $EVNDISPSYS/scripts/CTA/ and  $EVNDISPSYS/scripts/VTS/

These scripts allow to run the different stages of eventdisplay efficently on a farm.

Note that you might have to adjust the scripts to your local environment 
(please report this, the scripts should only depend on environmental variables)
