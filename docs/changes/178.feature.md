Improve dispBDT analysis for small arrays.

Re-calculate stereo parameters for the array configuration under consideration. This was actually a bug,
as the stereo parameters calculated for the full (hyper) array were used to calculate the emission height
and the direction coordinates used for the `cross` calculation. Recalculate using the simple stereo
reconstructor.

Change scale to logarithmic for several variables used by the dispBDTs (width, tgrad_x, length, cross) to improve
regression performance.
