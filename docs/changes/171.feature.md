Improvements to small-array analysis:

- acceptance of loss values > 0.2 and introduction of mitigating steps
- dispBDTEnergy trains on logE instead of `TMath::Power( 10., fdisp_energy_T[i] * log10( img_size[i] ) );`
- energy reconstruction (dispBDTEnergy) uses median instead of weighted mean
- introduce `TRAIN_RECO_QUALITY` and `TRAIN_RECO_METHOD` BDT machine learners
- improved weight expression for training of dispBDTs
- (many typo and code layout fixes)
